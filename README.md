# pcb-defect-detection
This project focuses on detecting defects on PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) using image processing techniques. It includes various files and folders related to annotations, references, results, and transformations. The goal is to automate the identification and analysis of PCB defects, improving quality control and efficiency.
# **PCB Defect Detection System**

## **Project Overview**
This project is designed to detect defects in PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) using image processing techniques. It automates the identification and classification of defects, enhancing quality control in manufacturing processes.

## **Project Structure**
- **Annotations/**: Contains labeled data for defect detection.
- **Reference/**: Includes reference images and guidelines for defect classification.
- **Results/**: Stores output images and analysis results.
- **Rotation/**: Contains scripts and data related to image transformations.
- **final**: Core file related to the project.
- **rapor_final.docx**: Detailed project report.

## **Installation & Setup**
### **Requirements**
Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## **Running the Project**
To execute the project, run:

```bash
python detect_defects.py
```
This will process the PCB images and generate defect detection results.

## **Project Outputs**
- **Defect Detection Results**: Highlighted defects on PCB images.
- **Classification Reports**: Analysis of different types of defects.
- **Processed Images**: Transformed and annotated PCB images.
